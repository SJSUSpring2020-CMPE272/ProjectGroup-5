## Project Idea-1

1. Crystal 

2. Predicting Success Rate of Kickstarter Projects

3. The goal of the project is to help entrepreneurs save time. For a Kickstarter project receive its full funds, it must reach its target amount within the proposed time frame. So if the project is even a dollar short of its goal by the end of the term, Kickstarter will not release the funds for that project. Our app will predict whether a Kickstarter idea will succeed or fail, then generate a statistical report for users to view the positive and negative factors that led to the end result. 

4. Technology stack: AWS, Django, Python, JS, HTML/CSS
